Hello! I'm Muhender Raj Rajvee, and this is my blog. You'll see me (hopefully) posting here 
about interesting new stuff I'm learning about. Most of the posts here might (or might not) be 
programming-related, but I could also post about other things, including music (I play the piano
 at an intermediate level) and attempting to learn new languages.

As of now, this blog is a blank slate for me, and we'll see what comes out of this!
